# Shooting Demo

Watch the videos and follow along to use arrays (lists) to create projectiles.

Part 1: Create a list of projectiles and display them: https://youtu.be/Aw9kMrPktfc 

Part 2: Removing projectiles that went off-canvas: https://youtu.be/HBZxTdi04Zk 

Part 3: Checking for collisions: https://youtu.be/OAgn87WNX0I 

When you are done, you can expand the project to:
* Implement the scoring system
* Create more enemies
* Make the player shoot up instead of across
* Add a second player to make dodgeball and throw projectiles at each other
* Move the player and shoot in multiple directions (up, down left right)
* Use the mouse to aim the projectiles
